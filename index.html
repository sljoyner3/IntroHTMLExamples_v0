    This is the index page (named index.html).  

    The index page is the default page that will show up when someone visits yourwebsite.com.

    HTML (HyperText Markup Language), in its most basic form, 
    is simply a language to format content for display on the web.
    It's not a programming langauge - it's a markup langauge!  
    HTML uses "tags" to define containers for your content. 
    The type of tag defines the type of content, and how that content should be presented.
    HTML has come a long way since it was first created (1993).  
    These days, when it comes to formatting content, we usually use something called CSS,
    which we'll talk more about eventually.

    This page has only some of the most basic elements of an HTML page - it consists of:
    <ul>
        <li>A "head" block (between the <small>&lthead&gt</small> and <small>&lt/head&gt</small> tags). Head blocks define various metadata properties of the page, such as its title, but is not displayed on the page itself</li>
        <br>
        <li> The large header on top of the page was created using the <small>&lth1&gt</small> and <small>&lt/h1&gt</small> tags</li>
        <br>
        <li>A body (between the <small>&ltbody&gt</small> and <small>&lt/body&gt</small> tags).  This is where your main content usually lives</li>
        <br>
        <li>This list, which is called an "unordered list" and is defined by <small>&ltul&gt</small>  and <small>&lt/ul&gt</small> tags</li>
        <br>
        <li>Some very basic formatting, like adjusting the font size of the tag names above</li>
        <br>
        <li>A link to another page below, which won't exist until we create it!</li>
    </ul>
