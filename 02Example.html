        <h1> All About Coin Tossing </h1>
        <h2> Definition </h2>
        <p> Coin flipping, coin tossing, or heads or tails is the practice of 
            throwing a coin in the air and checking which side is showing when 
            it lands, in order to choose between two alternatives, heads or 
            tails, sometimes used to resolve a dispute between two parties. 
            It is a form of sortition which inherently has two possible outcomes. 
            The party who calls the side that the coin lands on wins.
        </p>
        <h2> History </h2>
        <p> The historical origin of coin flipping is the interpretation of a 
            chance outcome as the expression of divine will[citation needed]. 
            <br><br>
            Coin flipping was known to the Romans as navia aut caput ("ship or head"), 
            as some coins had a ship on one side and the head of the emperor on the 
            other. In England, this was referred to as cross and pile.

            The coin may be any type as long as it has two distinct sides; it need not be a circulating coin as such.
